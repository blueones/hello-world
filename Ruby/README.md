#Environment Setup
Go to https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/ and install Ruby (if it isn't already loaded). Ruby is pretty straight-forward and doesn't require much to setup or run. You can use any text editor you wish. A few suggestions would be Atom by Github or Sublime Text 2 since both are FREE.

#Building/Compiling
Open a text editor, navigate to wherever you want to save the folder to or create 'hello.rb' in a folder, navigate to it, copy the single line of code and save it OR just write: `puts "hello world!"` and then save your file.

#Running
In your console, navigate to where you saved 'hello.rb' file. Run the command `ruby hello.rb` and that's it! Your console should spit out the infamous phrase.
